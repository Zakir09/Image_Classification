<h2 id="project-overview">Project Overview</h2>
Recognizing political figures in images is a complex task that combines computer vision and deep learning. This project builds an image classification model that identifies well-known political figures based on facial features. The goal is to develop an AI-powered tool that can analyze an uploaded image and predict which political figure it contains.

<h2 id="dataset--model">Dataset & Model</h2>

### üñº Dataset
The dataset consists of images of political figures, which were scraped from **Google Images**. To ensure a diverse dataset, images were collected from various sources, covering different angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds. The images were then preprocessed to enhance model performance.

### üèó Model
The classification model was built using **Scikit-Learn** with different machine learning algorithms. The final pipeline includes:  
- **Feature Extraction**: Images were processed using **OpenCV** and **Wavelet Transforms** to extract facial features.  
- **Model Training**: Multiple classifiers were tested, including:
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **Logistic Regression**  
  The best-performing model was selected based on classification accuracy.  
- **Evaluation**: Performance was assessed using metrics like **confusion matrix**, **precision**, and **recall**.

<h2 id="limitations--future-improvements">Limitations & Future Improvements</h2>

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations
- **Limited Recognition Scope**: The model is currently trained to recognize only **around 20 political figures**. This restricts its ability to classify a wider range of individuals.  
- **Face Detection Issues**: At times, the model **fails to detect a face**, even when one is clearly visible. This can be due to variations in lighting, image quality, or pose.  
- **Model Bias**: Since the dataset was scraped from Google Images, it may contain biases based on image availability and source diversity.  

### üöÄ Future Improvements
- **Expand Dataset**: Increase the number of political figures and collect more diverse images to improve recognition accuracy.  
- **Enhance Face Detection**: Implement a more advanced face detection model, such as **MTCNN** or **Dlib**, to reduce false negatives.  
- **Improve Model Performance**: Experiment with **deep learning models** (e.g., CNNs using TensorFlow/PyTorch) to enhance classification accuracy.
